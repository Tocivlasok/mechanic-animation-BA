All three pigs decided to build a house, and set off to the brickworks to buy some bricks.
But soon the three little pigs came across a Man carrying a bundle of straw.
The first little pig said to himself:
"Now I won't need to walk so far to the brickworks! I'd much rather do less work, and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing."
So the first little pig said to the Man carrying straw:
"Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house."

The Man did, and the little Pig quickly built a house with it right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for
the rest of the afternoon.

Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."
