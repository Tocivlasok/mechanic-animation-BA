        If play_with_string.main() has exactly 1 input arg 
        which is a valid path to the file,
        it will open it, read its content, and transform line by line
        (reverse and uppercase).
        
        If play_with_string.main() has exactly 1 input arg, which is not valid path,
        it will transform it in 3 different ways
        (reverse, uppercase, combined transformation).
        
        If play_with_string.main() has more than 1 input arg,
        it will transform those in 3 different ways each
        (reverse, uppercase, combined transformation).
