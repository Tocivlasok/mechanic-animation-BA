from string_funcs import play_with_string

If play_with_string.main() has exactly 1 input arg 
which is a valid path to the file,
it will open it, read its content, and transform line by line
(reverse and uppercase).

If play_with_string.main() has exactly 1 input arg, which is not valid path,
it will transform it in 3 different ways
(reverse, uppercase, combined transformation).

If play_with_string.main() has more than 1 input arg,
it will transform those in 3 different ways each
(reverse, uppercase, combined transformation).
